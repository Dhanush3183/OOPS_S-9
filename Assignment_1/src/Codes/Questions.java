//
//
//Q1. A company tracks daily clock-ins as pairs HH:mm start, HH:mm end. Write a Java program using LocalTime and Duration 
//    to compute total hours worked for the day. Treat end earlier than start as next-day finish.
//    
//Q2. Consider Strings str1, str2, and str3, given as follows: String str1 = "Hello World"; String str2 = "hello world"; 
//    String str3 = "Hello World"; What are the results of the following expressions? str1 == str2, str1 == str3, 
//    str1.equals(str2), str1.equals(str3), str1.compareTo(str2), str2.compareTo(str3). Provide justification for output.
//    
//Q3. Write a Java program that takes a string input representing a temperature in Celsius (e.g., "36.5") and Converts it 
//    to float and double using type conversion. Converts it to int using explicit casting (truncate decimal).Displays 
//    all three forms.
//    
//Q4. Write a program that takes an integer and checks If it’s prime and less than 100 and it’s not divisible by 2 or 5. 
//    Use logical operators to combine conditions.
//    
//Q5. Write a Java program to manage a company’s sales data using a 2D array, where each row corresponds to a salesperson 
//    and each column represents monthly sales figures for a given year. Use nested loops to calculate total annual sales 
//    and average monthly sales for each salesperson. Classify performance into categories: "Excellent", "Good", "Average",
//    "Poor". Display a report showing monthly data, totals, averages, and performance category per salesperson.
